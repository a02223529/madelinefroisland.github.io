											<h3>3 Years of Experience</h3>
											<p>I completed a minor in Statistics, and it has really added to my understanding 
												of data analytics. This minor helped me get experience with R and SAS, and 
												helped me to get more experience with different methods of analysis. The most 
												relevant (and challenging) class I took was an introduction to Machine Learning, 
												where we learned the math that goes behind machine learning models like k-means 
												clustering, decision trees, and logistic regression. I am also comfortable with 
												dimensionality reduction and other technical statistical methods.

													<h2><a href="#"><strong>Python</strong></a></h2>
												</header>
												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="../images/python.png" alt="" /></a>
												<h3>3 Years of Experience</h3>
												<p>I have completed many different projects in Python. 
													One of the first projects I was involved in was to construct a nueral network 
													to take an internal video of a boiler and return an error message when the fireball 
													that heats the boiler was irregular. My team and I wrote around 2,000 lines of code to 
													complete this project, and it gave me exposure to AWS and using Python for a very 
													in-depth statistical analysis. I have since done multiple Machine Learning projects 
													with Python. 
													<!-- Click here to see some of my favorite projects! -->
													I also compiles a Python dictionary of a list of free USU resources available to students. 
													I then connected this dictionary to a Qualtrics survey which would allow students to 
													answer 4 questions and receive an email with a unique list of the resources that are 
													available to them.

													<h2><strong>SQL Server</strong></h2>
												</header>
												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="../images/sql.png" alt="" /></a>
												<h3>1 Year of Experience</h3>
												<p>I have spent a lot of time writing Sequel Server code. I am very comfortable 
													with basic queries, table joins, and using SQL to complete other tasks. I 
													have had two full classes dedicated to SQL, and am very comfortable with it. It 
													is something that I am excited to continue to learn and get experience with!

													<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="../images/rcode.png" alt="" /></a>
													<h3>I mean isn't it possible?</h3>
													<p>I have used R Code in a lot of my statistics classes. I have completed many 
														different models and analysis in R, like K-means clustering, linear and logistic 
														regression, and decision trees. I am comfortable with the language of R, and I am excited 
														to continue to learn more about R and how to use it better!

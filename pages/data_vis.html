											<h3>Click Here To See A Visualization I Created!</h3>
											</a>
											<p>I have completed hundreds of visualizations in Tableau, using simple data with a few 
												years of data or data with thousands of observations. I have created simple dashboards 
												that show one or two findings to stakeholders and stories that show the entire purchasing 
												journey of a customer, and highlight problems within that journey. I can communicate
												data findings through simple charts or create very technical visualizations using 
												python in conjunction with Tableau. 
												<!-- The first real experience I had with data 
												analytics was in Tableau, when my team of 4 and I won a state-wide Data Analytics 
												Competition sponsored by MarketStar. This competition inspired my love for data 
												and change my major from Marketing to Data Analytics. -->

												<h3>2 Years of Experience</h3>
												<p>I have had a lot of professional experience with PowerBI. I have used it to 
													communicate business findings to managers and people all through large corporations.
													At the Space Dynamics Lab I used PowerBI to report productivity and changes in 
													personell. At Koch Industries I created multiple dashboards to explore the 
													effectiveness of changing software policies. I presented these findings to multiple 
													stakeholders and found multiple areas to help people adjust to the new software.

												<h3>1 Year of Experience</h3>
												<p>I competed with 2 other people in the world-wide Adobe Analytics competition. 
													We were given the data from Hilton Hotels and asked to answer 3 business 
													questions about the purchasing journey of customers. We did an extensive 
													analysis in Adobe Analytics, finding areas of high drop off on the webiste, 
													similarities among people who book through a third party, and predicting the 
													purpose of people's stay with Hilton.

													<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="../images/excel.png" alt="" /></a>
													<h3>3 Years of Experience</h3>
													<p>I am very comfortable with multiple capacities of Excel. I have used it extensively 
														in school and the workplace, and I am comfortable with complicated functions, 
														vlookups, pivot tables, and data visualization in Excel. I have used it for data cleaning, 
														data exploration, and data validation. At Koch Industries we used Excel for data 
														validation, and I spent countless hours comparing rows of data to ensure that data transfers
														went smoothly and errors were minimized.

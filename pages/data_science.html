											<h3>I mean isn't it possible?</h3>
											<p>Some of my favorite projects in machine learning have been predicting the popularity of
												song using publicly available Spotify datasets. I have also taken data from Nasa to 
												predict if a celestial body is hazardous or not. Many of the projects I have completed 
												include all parts of the machine learning process, including data preparation and cleaning, 
												initial analysis and data understanding, testing and training multiple different models, 
												and interpreting results.

												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="../images/nueralnet.png" alt="" /></a>
												<h3>I mean isn't it possible?</h3>
												<p>I have tuned and constructed multiple nueral networks. I have recently constructed a nueral 
													network to take the input from wearable devices and predict the activity that is being performed. 
													I have also used nueral networks to explore the relationship between measured polutants and the 
													air quality of a certain day. These processes have included data preparation, baseline testing, 
													hyperparameter tuning, model optimization, and interpretation of results.

												</header>
												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="../images/process.png" alt="" /></a>
												<h3>I mean isn't it possible?</h3>
												<p>I have done multiple projects with image processing. I used a neural network 
													to detect whether a person was looking left, right, or to the center. I also worked 
													with a team of 5 to create an autoencoder that would predict if a fireball was becoming
													irregular and problematic to chemical manufacturing systems. I have been involved in 
													every part of this process, image processing, model tuning, model testing, and implimentation.
